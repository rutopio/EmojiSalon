**EmojiSalon** allows you to customize the colors of emojis, just like dressing them up with various cosmetics or coloring them with different paints.

</div>

## Introduction

EmojiSalon uses [Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) SVG data for emoji rendering. You can select any emoji, customize its colors, and download your creation as SVG or PNG for personal or commercial use.

## Usage

Live Page: [https://emojisalon.chingru.com/showcase](https://emojisalon.chingru.com/showcase)

### Extend Emoji & For Fun

Create unique emoji variations by changing colors to match your style or brand.

### Cross-cultural Design

Adapt emojis for different cultural contexts or create region-specific variations.

### Accessibility

Emoji accessibility is not just a binary between being able to see emoji perfectly and not being able to see them at all — it is a spectrum that accounts for multiple experiences.

#### Challenges for Visually Impaired Users

For people with color vision deficiencies, color blindness, or low vision, identifying certain emojis can be challenging:

- **Similar colors**: Emoji may appear blurry or distorted, making it difficult to distinguish between similar-looking icons
- **Color-based identification**: Many users identify emoji by color or general shape rather than fine details
- **Multiple emoji in sequence**: When several emoji appear in a row, they can be hard to tell apart, especially with similar colors
- **Small keyboard icons**: Emoji keyboards have small icons arranged closely together, making selection difficult

#### Commonly Confused Emoji

**Flag emoji** with similar color schemes are particularly problematic:

- 🇮🇹 Italy vs 🇮🇪 Ireland
- 🇷🇴 Romania vs 🇹🇩 Chad
- 🇱🇻 Latvia vs 🇦🇹 Austria
- 🇲🇨 Monaco vs 🇮🇩 Indonesia

**Heart emoji** colors can also be easily confused:

- ❤️ Red vs 💜 Purple
- 💙 Blue vs 💜 Purple
- 💚 Green vs 🧡 Orange

#### How EmojiSalon Helps

Most current emoji designs do not consider these accessibility needs. EmojiSalon provides a solution by allowing users to:

- Customize emoji colors for better personal distinction
- Create high-contrast variants tailored to individual visual needs
- Generate easily distinguishable emoji for users with specific color vision deficiencies

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rutopio/emoji-salon.git
   cd EmojiSalon
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The development server should now be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The app is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/). The build output in `dist/` can be served as a static site on any platform.

## Data Preprocessing

The emoji SVG data used in this application is preprocessed from [Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) source files into one per-emoji JSON file each. The whole pipeline is a single reproducible Node script — no fonts, no Glyphs App, no manual steps.

```bash
pnpm preprocess
```

This shallow-clones `jdecked/twemoji` at a pinned tag, parses every `assets/svg/*.svg` (skipping skin-tone-modifier files), and writes per-emoji data to `public/data/emoji/u<code>.json` plus an `index.json`. Each file holds the emoji's SVG paths, fills, and editable colors, served as static assets and fetched on demand by both the app and the OG image function.

See [`preprocess/README.md`](./preprocess/README.md) for the pinned tag, output format, and details.
